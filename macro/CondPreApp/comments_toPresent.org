* Higgs Pt reweighting NNLO:
  - I contacted Pascuale [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/14c97cc955bb9280][here]]

* slide 12. Can you check the yields at pre-selection level for the signal? They look too large taking into account the expected sigma X BR and luminosity. 
  - There was a mistake in the code. For illustration on plots, we enlarge the signal cross section by a factor of 30. Mistakenly, this factor has appeared in the yields.

* The issue with the jet pt threshold needs to be fixed. We recommend to do this fix before showing any of the additional studies and changes. 
   - Before doing the prodcuion I need to make sure that the genInfo are accessible in our PAT-tuples.
   - GenParticles are in PATtuples.
   - How to keep Higgs in RDS files?
     - Done. It has two part: SM Higgs and BSM Higgs
   - How to change the pt threshold of jets?
     - Done!
   - How to run on GRID and put everything on llbb
     - Done!
** TODO Check the final number of events if they make sense
   - Ongoing
* Check the expected sensitivity for a simple set of proposed cuts w.r.t. the nominal mass dependent selection. The current option seems to be hard to justify.

** could you please revisit the optimization and show S/sqrt(S+B) after the optimization and at preselection level in the same mass window.
* Can you show the m_mumubb mass distribution in a narrower mass range to show if the peak is at 125 GeV. Due to the tails, are you sure that you don't need asymmetric requirements?. 
  - The peak is exactly at 125 GeV and asymmetric cut introduces more background as shown in the picture [[http://ajafari.web.cern.ch/ajafari/SignalvsDY_fullSel.gif]] 
* Can you check the discriminating power of m_mumubb and m_bb and the combination in 2D? We would like to see if this variable has additional power and if it can be used in the selection. 
  - m_mumubb is already in the game. We apply a cut on that.
  - the mbb power is meaningful, in the sense of being mass-independent, when it is constrained to |mbb - m\mu\mu| which is a feasture of signal. The problem with this variable is that there is a shape discrepancy between data and MC. Hence optimization on this would not be relaible.
